Installation

1. git clone https://github.com/yourusername/linux-security-audit.git
2. cd linux-security-audit


3. chmod +x security_audit_hardening.sh
4. sudo ./security_audit_hardening.sh
  

6. Custom Security Checks
You can extend the script with custom security checks by modifying the custom_security_checks function. This allows you to tailor the script to specific organizational policies or requirements.

6.Email Alerts
To enable email alerts for critical vulnerabilities, uncomment the send_alerts function call in the main function. Ensure your server is configured to send emails (e.g., using mail or sendmail).

If your server does not require IPv6, the script will disable it as part of the hardening process. You can modify or remove this step if your environment requires IPv6.
